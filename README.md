# Chatbot-Howto
#Support Agent Chatbot for CDPs Overview This project is a Support Agent Chatbot designed to help users answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot leverages Flask, Whoosh, and spaCy to provide answers based on the official documentation of each platform.

Features Answer "How-to" Questions: The chatbot can answer specific questions related to setting up and using features in Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.

Cross-CDP Comparisons: The chatbot can compare features across multiple platforms based on user queries (e.g., audience creation in Segment vs. Lytics).

Advanced "How-to" Questions: The bot can handle more complex or platform-specific questions using pre-indexed documentation.

Search Functionality: The chatbot searches through indexed documentation to find the most relevant responses to user queries.

Tech Stack Backend:

Flask: Python web framework to build the API and serve the chatbot. Whoosh: A fast search engine library for indexing and searching the documentation. spaCy: Natural Language Processing library for understanding user queries. Frontend:

Basic HTML/CSS/JS for user interaction with the chatbot. Data Source: Official documentation from Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.

Setup Instructions

Install Required Libraries Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended). Then, install the required libraries by running:
bash Copy Edit pip install Flask spacy whoosh 2. Download spaCy Language Model You need to download the spaCy language model to process user queries:

bash Copy Edit python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm 3. Run the Flask Application Start the Flask application by running the following command:

bash Copy Edit python app.py This will run the application locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Open the Chatbot Interface Open the index.html file in your browser to interact with the chatbot. Type in your "how-to" questions, and the chatbot will provide answers based on the indexed documentation.
Usage To ask the chatbot a question, type it into the text box and click the "Ask" button. You can ask questions like: "How do I set up a new source in Segment?" "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?" "How do I create an audience in Lytics?" "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?" "How does Segment compare to Lytics in audience creation?" How it Works User Input: When a user submits a question, itâ€™s processed by spaCy to identify the intent and determine if it's a "how-to" question.

Search: If the query is recognized as a "how-to" question, the chatbot performs a search using Whoosh to find relevant information from the indexed documentation.

Response: The chatbot returns the most relevant answer or instruction from the documentation.

Cross-CDP Comparison: If the query asks for a comparison, the chatbot provides a predefined response comparing the features of the CDPs.

Enhanced NLP: Use more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., intent classification, semantic search) to handle more complex user queries. User Interface Enhancements: Improve the frontend using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js to create a more dynamic and interactive experience.
